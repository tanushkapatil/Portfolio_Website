## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **Animations:** CSS Keyframes + JS Scroll/Event Triggers
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach using media queries

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- On page load, sections animate into view using `animation-timeline: view()`.
- Hovering over a project video triggers autoplay and shows a hover sign.
- The hamburger menu triggers a sidebar animation with smooth transitions.
- Media queries ensure a clean experience across all screen sizes.

## 📱 Responsive Breakpoints

| Screen Width      | Adjustments Made                              |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `≤ 1200px`        | Smaller headers, scaled sections              |
| `≤ 700px`         | Sidebar replaces top nav, column stacking     |
| `≤ 480px`         | Hidden video boxes, minimized typography      |
